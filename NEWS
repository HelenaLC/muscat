Changes in version 1.1.1

o significant speed-up of aggregateData() by replacing usage
  of rowX() over a list with scuttle::summarizeAssayByGroup()
  
o added options use "prop.detected" and "num.detected" 
  as summary statistic (argument 'fun') in aggregateData()

o added parallelization support in aggregateData() and pbDS() through argument BBPARAM
  (passed to scater::sumCountsAcrossCells() and BiocParallel::bplapply, respectively)

o aggregateData() now stores the number of cells that went into aggregation under
  int_colData(.)$n_cells (vs. metadata(.)$n_cells) to support automated subsetting
  
o replaced argument n_threads with BPPARAM throughout all 
  parallelizable functions (aggregateData(), pbDS(), mmDS())
  
o bug fix in prepSim(): the function previously failed when 
  cluster/sample/group_id cell metadata columns were non-factors
  
o bug fix in resDS(): cpm = TRUE previously didn't handle
  missing cluster-sample combinations correctly
