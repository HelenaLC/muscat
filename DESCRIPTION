Package: muscat
Title: Multi-sample multi-group scRNA-seq data analysis tools
Description: `muscat` provides various methods and visualization tools 
    for DS analysis in multi-sample, multi-group, multi-(cell-)subpopulation 
    scRNA-seq data, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on 
    aggregated “pseudobulk” data, as well as a flexible simulation platform 
    that mimics both single and multi-sample scRNA-seq data.
